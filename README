dlvhex-caspplugin -- Constraint ASP plugin for dlvhex

To install:
$ ./bootstrap.sh (uses files in dlvhex-common from hexhex/build!)
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install (maybe also non-root, depending on configure options)

To modify src/caspconverter.cpp, the file you really have to modify
is src/caspconverter.l. After changes in the .l file are done, run
$ flex caspconverter.l
which will generate the new caspconverter.cpp (you'll need Flex).
Still, you (probably) won't need Flex if you don't need to modify
caspconverter.cpp, or if you manage to directly modify it (start
reading the file from the end, in that case!)
